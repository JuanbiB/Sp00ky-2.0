# Sp00ky-2.0
The revival and overhaul of our initial idea!

First project for our 361 Game Design course. 

You're a sp00ky skeleton trying to get back your bones from the evil dog empire! Lucky for you, they have poor eyesight but alas, 
a keen sense of smell! Sneak your way to anatomical completion in this riveting puzzle game.
